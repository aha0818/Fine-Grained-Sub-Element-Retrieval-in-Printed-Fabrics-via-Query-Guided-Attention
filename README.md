This repository contains the implementation of the paper **《Fine-Grained Sub-Element Retrieval in Printed Fabrics via Query-Guided Attention》
**.
# Overview
Accurate fine-grained image retrieval is a critical challenge in pattern recognition, especially in industrial scenarios where local semantic alignment is essential. This work focuses on the specific task of retrieving printed fabric images based on a query sub-element (e.g., a specific pattern or motif), which is a demanding case of pattern search and matching.
Existing methods relying on global features often fail to capture fine-grained local semantics, limiting their performance in distinguishing fabrics with similar overall appearances but varying sub-element details. To address this gap, we propose a novel two-stage retrieval framework centered on a query-guided attention mechanism:
1. **Initial Retrieval**:
